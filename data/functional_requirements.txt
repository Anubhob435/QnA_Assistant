Document 4:  
Product Specification - Functional Requirements (InsightAnalyst - Dashboard 
Sharing Feature) 
Feature: Dashboard Sharing & Collaboration 
• 1. User Story: As a user, I want to be able to share my dashboards with other team 
members so that we can collaborate on data analysis and insights. 
• 2. Functional Requirements:  
o FR1: Users must be able to share a dashboard via a unique, shareable link. 
o FR2: Users must be able to set permissions for shared dashboards (e.g., view
only, can edit). 
o FR3: Shared users with 'view-only' permission should not be able to modify the 
dashboard structure or filters. 
o FR4: Shared users with 'can edit' permission should have the ability to modify 
dashboard components, apply filters, and save changes (changes should reflect for 
all with access or create a new version, TBD). 
o FR5: The system must allow sharing with specific registered users within the 
organization or with external users via email invitation (if enabled by admin). 
o FR6: Users should be able to revoke access to a shared dashboard at any time. 
o FR7: The dashboard owner should see a list of users with whom the dashboard is 
currently shared and their permission levels. 
• 3. Acceptance Criteria:  
o A dashboard can be successfully shared with another user who can view it 
according to the set permissions. 
o Permission changes (e.g., view-only to can-edit) are reflected immediately for the 
shared user. 
o Access revocation prevents the shared user from accessing the dashboard.
